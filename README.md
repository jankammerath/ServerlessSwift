# Serverless Swift with Vapor and AWS SAM

This is a boilerplate application that shows how to run a serverless Swift application on AWS Lambda using AWS SAM. The Lambda operates on Linux running on AWS Graviton2 CPUs with an arm64 architecture. It uses a local proxy to interact with the [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/) framework.
